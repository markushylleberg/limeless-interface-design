## Programming guidelines

<b>Mobile first</b>

        We will code this application in mobile first

<b>Naming conventions</b>

        (JS) Write the javascript in a OOP matter

        (JS) Base function names on their action - descripe what they do
            eg. functions like; function showFilter(){};

        (JS) camelCase for javascript variables and functions
            eg. functions like; function myFunction(){};
            eg. variables like; const firstName = 'John';

        (CSS) Hyphen and lowercase for CSS-naming 
            eg. 'red-box: background: red'

        (CSS) We will try as much as we can to build our stylesheet based on our style guide
              and in that way build a framework to maintain consistancy on our site

        (HTML & CSS & JS) ID's will always be refered as camelCase
    
<b>XD & Style guide</b>
