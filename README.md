# limeless-interface-design
Final project for our interface design class

## Programming guidelines

###1 Mobile first
    We will code this application in mobile first

###2 Naming conventions

        (JS) camelCase for javascript variables and functions
            eg. functions like; function myFunction(){};
            eg. variables like; const firstName = 'John';

        (CSS) Hyphen and lowercase for CSS-naming 
            eg. 'red-box: background: red'

        (CSS) We will try as much as we can to build our stylesheet based on our style guide
              and in that way build a framework to maintain consistancy on our site
    
###3 XD & Style guide
    Use our style guide and XD-prototype for styling
